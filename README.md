#E-Commerce Project

How to run the project??

1) Clone the repository in Intellij or any IDE : https://github.com/Pranay-Rayke/E-Commerce.git
2) Go to application.properties.
3) Set url, username and password. (Make sure port number might be different for you. Set it according to your system)
4) Create a database ecommerce. (Name must be same as in url)
5) Run the application.
6) Open the browser and paste the url : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html (Port Number might be different in your case. I have used Postman for test the API. Swagger is use only for documentation purpose.)
7) Now you can access all the API.
